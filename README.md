# Titanic_NN

In this project I have written a class for a simple but flexible Neural Network using numpy. I have then implemented a network using a dataset from Kaggle
mapping data about passengers on the Titanic to whether they survived or not. The dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

The class I have implemented allows flexible specification of learning rate, layers, number of neurons in each layer as well as the activation
functions for each layer. The network learns via backpropagation. A good explanation of the necessary calculus for this algorithm, as found 
in the '__calculate_grads' function, can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8
